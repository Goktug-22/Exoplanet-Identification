# Exoplanet-Identification
Exoplanets are planets located outside of our solar system. In search of habitable planets and extraterrestrial life, identificaion of exoplanets are crucial. There are several methods to find an exoplanet. This algorithm focuses on discovering patterns of light fluctiations to identify systems with at least one planet. Two find these patterns CNN and Decision Tree algorithms are used.

The dateset used is the light flux levels of several thousand stars captured in Kepler Space Campain-3. The dataset is public and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data
